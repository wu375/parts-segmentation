# PARTS model and segmentation training in pytorch
(On-going) My implementation of PARTS: Unsupervised segmentation with slots, attention and independence maximization.
<br/><br/>
Implementation is finished but there could be bugs in the model. \
For example, training is very computationally intensive, which could be due to a bug somewhere.
